# 00: Introduction and Disclaimer

## Introduction

This collection of documents provides a comprehensive, technical overview of the principles behind analyzing and
understanding the internal mechanics of a modern Android game. The content is structured as a series of focused
chapters, guiding a researcher from foundational concepts to advanced techniques.

The explicit goal is educational: to arm future anti-cheat developers and software security engineers with a deep
understanding of how these systems work from the inside out. To build effective defenses, one must first understand the
offense. This guide is for learning how cheats work, as that knowledge is a vital part of becoming an anti-cheat expert.
However, this knowledge must be used for study and defense, and never to cause harm or disrupt the experience of other
players.
